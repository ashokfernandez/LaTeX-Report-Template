## Description: 
This is a little template I put together when writing a [quickstart guide](http://ashokfernandez.wordpress.com/2013/05/01/getting-started-with-latex/) to using latex. It introduces latex along with the useful stuff like referencing and figures which are often tricky to people just getting started. Sometimes it's better to learn by example!

If you want to get started really quickly without having to worry about getting latex setup on your computer I highly recommend [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com?r=fb78b15c&rm=d&rs=b), it's like Google Docs for latex.
